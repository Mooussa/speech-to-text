Zero to One is Book writen by Peter Thiel on creating startup and building the future.

In this, I have write a Python program to translate this book from text format to speech. I did that because I like to read that over and over again, but I don't have enough time to read the book as frequent as I want. 

So the audio format will allow me while coding, to listen to the book as podcast. 

It may violate some copyright rules but since the book is publicly available on the internet, I am not sure that will be a great deal.

Let's start coding

################################################

To get started you might want to create virtual environment, but not mandotory.

$python -m venv [ENV_NAME]

Go ahead and install pyttsx3
This librairy contains the required fonctions(methods) for translating from text to speech

$pip install pyttsx3

You should also have the text format of the book stored or accessible somewhere in your working environment.

Once all done, follow the code
